#The Dragons Arena System:
##Distributed Simulation of Virtual Worlds

This repository contains the implementation for the DAS assignment for the VU course Distributed Systems.

To build the system, run `ant build` in the implementation directory. The runserver.sh script provides a wrapper of the command to run a server. For the current version, server IDs are hardcoded. A server instance should be run by `./runserver.sh [0-4]`.

The trace directory contains script and trace file for the prepared game trace from the [Game Trace Archive][1].
